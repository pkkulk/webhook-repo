Developer Assessment Task
The aim of this task is to assess your skills with a focus on bringing the necessary, but minimal
data to the UI from a webhook receiver.

The Problem Statement
Build a Github repository which automatically sends an event (webhook) on the following
Github actions ("Push", "Pull Request", "Merge") to a registered endpoint, and store it to
MongoDB.
The UI will keep pulling data from MongoDB every 15 seconds and display the latest
changes to the repo in the below format:
For PUSH action:
Format: {author} pushed to {to_branch} on {timestamp}
Sample: "Travis" pushed to "staging" on 1st April 2021 - 9:30 PM UTC
For PULL_REQUEST action:
Format: {author} submitted a pull request from {from_branch} to {to_branch} on
{timestamp}

Sample: "Travis" submitted a pull request from "staging" to "master" on 1st April 2021 - 9:00 AM
UTC
For MERGE action (Brownie Points):
Format: {author} merged branch {from_branch} to {to_branch} on {timestamp}
Sample: "Travis" merged branch "dev" to "master" on 2nd April 2021 - 12:00 PM UTC

Submission Details
Create a new repository action-repo to deal with Github actions using Github webhooks
Also create another repository webhook-repo for the endpoint. This is where you will write
the webhook end point code to capture changes done on action-repo.
Please use this repository for reference, and construct it accordingly. We have provided
the base code, you need to customize the code further.
Provide links to both these repositories for submission.

Implementation Specifics
Use Github webhooks for the integration with the action-repo. The github action will be
sent to the webhook endpoint.
The endpoint then stores the data to MongoDB in the below schema:
The webhook-repo must be implemented in Flask using the linked repository as reference.
MongoDB Schema

The data must then be reflected in the UI (keep polling from MongoDB every 15 seconds),
with only the necessary details being rendered neatly. The design is up to your choice, but it
must be clean and minimal.

Application Flow
Please find the complete flow below:

Note: After you have completed the code, make sure you test it properly and share with us the
links of both the repo you created in the Google Form Link shared with you in the application
form.
In this role we are looking for serious applicants who aspire to make the most out of this
opportunity to learn and grow with some awesome team mates and potentially convert this
internship in to a full time role.
